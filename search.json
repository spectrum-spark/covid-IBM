(2021) and is an extension of the work done in Conway et al. (2022) and Commonwealth Government of Australia (2021). This model extends on previous work by restructuring the existing model as a continuous-time, stochastic, IBM, where the neutralising antibody titre and age of the individual determines their transition probabilities. Furthermore, an emergency department (ED) compartment has been added as Moss et al. (2020) noted that limited ED consult capacity can cause a bottleneck that prevents admission to hospital. The full compartmental structure of the clinical outcomes model is depicted in Figure 1 .\nAll parameters governing the pathway each individual takes through the health system are altered depending upon their individual neutralising antibody titre. The evaluation of these transition probabilities are explained in full in the immunological model.\nFor symptomatic individual \\(i\\) in the line-list outputted from the transmission model, we determine if they are hospitalised by sampling, \\[\n    H \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p_{H| I}^i)\n\\] where \\(H\\) is an indicator variable for hospitalisation and \\(p_{H| I}^i\\) is the probability that individual \\(i\\) is hospitalised given symptomatic infection. If individual \\(i\\) requires hospitalisation they will present to the ED, where they may not be seen due to capacity limitations. ED consult capacity is modelled by admitting only the first \\(C_{ED}\\) presentations to ED each day. If individual \\(i\\) is not seen, they will present again to the ED with probability \\(1 - p_{\\text{L}|\\text{ED}}\\) after \\(\\tau_{\\text{L}|\\text{ED}}\\) days sampled from, \\[\n    \\tau_{\\text{L}|\\text{ED}} \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\kappa_{\\text{L}|\\text{ED}}, \\theta_{\\text{L}|\\text{ED}}),\n\\] where \\(p_{\\text{L}|\\text{ED}}\\) is the probability that an individual does not present again to the ED and \\(\\kappa_{\\text{L}|\\text{ED}}\\) and \\(\\theta_{\\text{L}|\\text{ED}}\\) are the shape and rate parameters of the gamma distribution respectively. For individuals that do not return to ED and are therefore not admitted to hospital, their age, neutralisation titre upon exposure and number of presentations to ED are recorded such that these can be used to understand possible excess mortality due to ED capacity limits. If individual \\(i\\) is admitted to hospital we determine what hospital pathway they will follow.\nThere are three initial pathways for hospitalised individual \\(i\\). Individual \\(i\\) will either recover and be discharged from a ward bed, die in a ward bed, or move to an ICU bed; as the three pathways have different length of stay distributions they modelled as three separate compartments \\(H_R\\), \\(H_D\\) and \\(\\ICU_{pre}\\). To determine which pathway individual \\(i\\) will follow, we sample from, \\[\n    X_h \\sim \\text{Categorical}({\\bf p}_{1}^i)\n\\] where \\(X_h\\) is the sampled hospital pathway, \\[\\begin{equation*}\n{\\bf p}_{1}^i= \\left[p_{\\ICU | H}^i, (1 - p_{\\ICU |H}^i)p_{H_D|\\ICU^c}^i, (1 - p_{\\ICU}^i)(1 - p_{H_D|\\ICU^c}^i)\\right]\n\\end{equation*}\\] is a vector containing the probability of transitioning into \\(\\ICU_{pre}\\), \\(H_D\\), or \\(H_R\\) respectively, \\(p_{\\ICU|H}^i\\) is the probability that individual \\(i\\) is admitted to ICU given they are hospitalised and \\(p_{H_D|\\ICU^c}^i\\) is the probability that individual \\(i\\) dies on ward given that they are in hospitalised and are not going to ICU. If individual \\(i\\) requires the ICU, they follow a further ICU pathway to determine their final outcome.\nThe pathway through the ICU also consists of three different components. Within the ICU pathway an individual will either die in the ICU (\\(\\ICU_D\\)), die in a ward bed after leaving the ICU (\\(\\ICU_{WD}\\)), or recover and be discharged from a ward bed after leaving the ICU (\\(\\ICU_{WR}\\)). We sample which pathway is taken within the ICU from, \\[\n    X_\\ICU \\sim \\text{Categorical}({\\bf p}_{2}^i)\n\\] where \\(X_\\ICU\\) is the sampled ICU pathway, \\[\\begin{equation*}\n{\\bf p}_{2}^i = \\left[p_{\\ICU_D|\\ICU}^i, (1 - p_{\\ICU_D|\\ICU}^i)p_{W_D|\\ICU_D^c}^i, (1 - p_{\\ICU_D|\\ICU}^i)(1 - p_{W_D|\\ICU_D^c}^i)\\right]\n\\end{equation*}\\] is a vector containing the probability of transitioning into the \\(\\ICU_D\\), \\(\\ICU_{WD}\\) or \\(\\ICU_{WR}\\) compartment respectively, \\(p_{\\ICU_D|\\ICU}^i\\) is the probability that individual \\(i\\) dies in the ICU given they were admitted to ICU and \\(p_{W_D|\\ICU_D^c}^i\\) is the probability that individual \\(i\\) of dies in a ward bed after leaving ICU without dying. For an individual that transitions into \\(\\ICU_{WR}\\) or \\(\\ICU_{WD}\\), they will move into a further ward compartment, \\(W_R\\) or \\(W_D\\), where they will either recover or die respectively.\nFinally, the length of stay for individual \\(i\\) in each compartment is sampled such that, \\[\n     \\tau_c \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\kappa_c, \\theta_c)\n\\] where \\(\\tau_c\\) is the time spent in compartment \\(c\\), and \\(\\kappa_c\\) and \\(\\theta_c\\) are the shape and rate parameter for compartment \\(c\\) respectively. Uncertainty is incorporated by sampling rate and shape parameters from the posterior estimated for the Australian Delta wave (Tobin et al. 2022). \nBy generating a clinical timeline for every symptomatic individual, we can calculate hospital admissions, ICU occupancy, ward occupancy and deaths by age in continuous-time. Furthermore, by explicitly incorporating the effects of neutralising antibodies on protection against each outcome, we are able to account for individual level immune responses. Note that we assume that neutralising antibody titre levels do not change the distribution of time spent in any compartment.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCommonwealth Government of Australia. 2021. “National Plan to Transition Australia’s National COVID-19 Response.” Australia. https://www.australia.gov.au/national-plan.\n\n\nConway, Eamon, Camelia Walker, Chris Baker, Michael Lydeamore, Gerard E Ryan, Trish Campbell, Joel C Miller, et al. 2022. “COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage Targets to Inform Reopening Plans in a Low Incidence Setting.” medRxiv, 2022–12.\n\n\nKnock, Edward S., Lilith K.

    "text": "\\[\n\\newcommand{ICU}{\\text{ICU}}\n\\] Within both the transmission model and the clinical outcomes model we include an immunological response to COVID-19. This immunological response is handled by directly modelling each individual’s neutralising antibody titre. By using the model of Khoury et al. (2021) and Cromer et al. (2022) we can relate an individual’s neutralising antibody titre to their protection against all outcomes of interest: infection, symptomatic disease, onward transmission given breakthrough infection, hospitalisation and death. The fact that each individual is assigned their own neutralising antibody titre results in inter-individual variation that leads to varying distributions of protection throughout the community, impacting the resulting dynamics. In the Australian context, by the time Delta and Omicron outbreaks occurred almost all immunity was vaccine-derived, therefore the model is initialised by considering neutralisating antibody titre from the vaccine roll out alone.\nAn individual’s neutralising antibody titre can be increased by a variety of exposures. The processes that we consider are: the first, second and booster dose of a vaccine, or infection occurring in an unvaccinated or vaccinated individual. Note that for simplicity we assume that infection prior to or following vaccination results in the same titre of neutralising antibody. Immune responses are stratified by the type of vaccine product, AstraZeneca (AZ) or mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna), that the individual has received based on supply and distribution data.\nAt the time of a boosting process, we sample the level of neutralising antibody titre that is acquired from, \\[\n    \\log_{10}(a_i^0) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu^x_j, \\sigma^2),\n\\] where \\(a_i^0\\) is the neutralising antibody titre that individual \\(i\\) is boosted to, \\(\\mu^x_j\\) is the mean neutralising antibody titre against strain \\(x\\) of the population after boosting process \\(j\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the variance of neutralising antibodies across the population.\nThe mean neutralising antibody titre, \\(\\mu^x_j\\), is set using logical rules based upon the infection and vaccination history of the individual. In our work it is assumed that an unvaccinated individual will have an average neutralising antibody titre of 0.0 on the \\(\\log_{10}\\)-scale after exposure. This is our baseline measurement and is used to calibrate across multiple neutralising antibody studies. For an individual that has no prior exposure to COVID-19, their vaccination induces an antibody response such that, \\[\n    \\mu^x_j = \\mu_j^0 + \\log_{10}(f_x),\n\\tag{1}\\] where \\(\\mu_j^0\\) is the mean level of neutralising antibody titre for vaccine \\(j\\) against a base strain of COVID-19 (for us this is Delta) and \\(f_x\\) is the fold change in neutralising antibody titre between the base strain and strain \\(x\\). To account for the effect of exposure to COVID-19 prior or post vaccination, we use an altered form of Equation 1. For brevity, we have used Table 1 to list the equations used to obtain \\(\\mu^x_j\\) with infection rather than include a description within text1.\n\n\nTable 1: Presented here are the relationships assumed within our immunological model for neutralising antibody titre for individuals that have been exposed to COVID-19. Here we have used the extended subscript with an E to represent prior or current exposure to the circulating strain of COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcesses\nAverage titre formula\n\n\n\n\nUnvaccinated (U\\(\\cap\\)E)\n\\(\\mu^x_{\\text{U}\\cap\\text{E}} = \\mu^0_\\text{U}\\)\n\n\nAZ dose 1 (AZ1\\(\\cap\\)E)\n\\(\\mu^x_{\\text{AZ1}\\cap\\text{E}} = \\mu_{\\text{P2}}^0\\)\n\n\nAZ dose 2 (AZ2\\(\\cap\\)E)\n\\(\\mu^x_{\\text{AZ2}\\cap\\text{E}} = \\mu_{\\text{B}}^0\\)\n\n\nPfizer dose 1 (P1\\(\\cap\\)E)\n\\(\\mu^x_{\\text{P1}\\cap\\text{E}} = \\mu_{\\text{P2}}^0\\)\n\n\nPfizer dose 2 (P2\\(\\cap\\)E)\n\\(\\mu^x_{\\text{P2}\\cap\\text{E}} = \\mu_{\\text{B}}^0\\)\n\n\nmRNA booster (B\\(\\cap\\)E)\n\\(\\mu^x_{\\text{B}\\cap\\text{E}} = \\mu_{\\text{B}}^0\\)\n\n\n\n\nIt is assumed that an individual’s titre of neutralising antibodies will decay after boosting. This decay is assumed to be exponential, therefore, \\[\n    \\log_{10}(a_i) = \\log_{10}(a_i^0) -\n         \\frac{k_a}{\\log(10.0)}t,\n\\tag{2}\\] where \\(a_i\\) is the time dependent neutralising antibody titre of individual \\(i\\), \\(k_a\\) is the decay rate of neutralising antibodies and \\(t\\) is the time from the last boosting process (to limit the computational cost of constantly converting neutralising antibodies, all equations are expressed in terms of \\(\\log_{10}(a_i)\\) in our work).\nTo convert the neutralising antibody titre of an individual to their protection against any disease outcome, \\(\\rho_\\alpha\\), we use \\[\n    \\rho_\\alpha = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-k (\\log_{10}(a_i) - c_{\\alpha}))}\n\\tag{3}\\] where \\(k\\) is governs the steepness of the logistic curve (logistic growth rate), and \\(c_{\\alpha}\\) defines the midpoint of the logistic function for disease outcome \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe immunological model interacts with the transmission model by altering the probability that an individual develops symptoms, \\(q_i\\), their rate of onward transmission given breakthrough infection, \\(\\tau_i\\), and the contact’s level of susceptibility, \\(\\xi_j\\).\nThe susceptibility of contact \\(j\\) is, \\[\n    \\xi_j = (1-\\rho_\\xi)\\xi^0_i,\n\\] where \\(\\rho_\\xi\\) is the protection against infection and \\(\\xi_i^0\\) is the susceptibility of the \\(i\\)th individual if they were completely COVID naive. The probability that individual \\(i\\) develops symptoms is governed by, \\[\n    q_i = \\frac{1 - \\rho_q}{1 - \\rho_\\xi}q_i^0,\n\\tag{4}\\] where \\(\\rho_q\\) is the protection against symptomatic infection and \\(q_i^0\\) is the probability of symptomatic infection for individual \\(i\\) if they were completely COVID naive (zero neutralising antibody titre).\nTo model the onward transmission rate more care must be taken. It is assumed in our model that asymptomatic individuals are 50% less likely to infect their contacts when compared to their symptomatic counterpart. However, this reduction in transmission due to asymptomatic infections is not accounted for in the clinical trial data used to calibrate the protection against onward transmission. To avoid double counting the effect of the neutralising antibodies we alter the functional form for the rate of onward transmission to, \\[\n    \\tau_i = \\frac{s(1 - \\rho_\\tau)(1 + q_i^0)}{1+ q_i} \\beta_i,\n\\tag{5}\\] where \\(s\\) is either 0.5 or 1 depending upon whether the individual is asymptomatic or symptomatic respectively, \\(\\rho_\\tau\\) is the protection against onward transmission and \\(\\beta_i\\) is the baseline (zero neutralising antibody titre) infectiousness of the infector. Note that \\(\\beta_i\\) depends upon the age of the individual and the expected transmission potential of the population.\nTo reduce the computational cost of updating the immunological component of the transmission model for each individual at every timestep, we only solve the immunological component of the IBM when we require the protection against an outcome of interest. This is done by storing the time of last boost of neutralising antibodies and the titre that the individual was boosted to. When required, we update the individual’s neutralising antibody titre to the current timestep using this stored information.\nThe clinical outcomes model uses the transmission model as an intermediary between the immunological response of each infected individual and their corresponding clinical outcome. This is done by outputting each infected individual’s neutralising antibody titre at the point of exposure, a symptom indicator and their time of symptom onset for use within the clinical pathways model.\nThe immunological model determines the probability of hospitalisation, ICU requirement and death based on observed relationships between neutralising antibody titres and clinical endpoint outcomes from efficacy studies. For a symptomatic individual \\(i\\), the probability of hospitalisation is given by \\[\n    p_{H | I }^i = \\frac{OR\\left(p^0_{H|E},\\rho_h(a_i)\\right)}{q_i},\n\\] where \\(p^0_{H|E}\\) is the baseline probability of hospitalisation given infection, \\(\\rho_h(a_i)\\) is the protection against hospitalisation, \\(a_i\\) is individual \\(i\\)’s neutralising antibody titre at the point of exposure, and \\[\nOR(p,r)= \\frac{\\frac{rp}{p-1}}{1+\\frac{rp}{1-p}},\n\\] is the function that uses odds ratio \\(r\\) and baseline probability \\(p\\) to compute an adjusted probability.\nIf individual \\(i\\) is hospitalised, the probabilities governing which hospital pathway is chosen are altered such that, \\[\np_{\\ICU | H}^i = \\frac{OR\\left(p^0_{\\ICU| E} ,\\rho_h(a_i)\\right)}{p_{H| I }^iq_i},\n\\] and, \\[\n    p_{H_D|ICU^c}^i = \\frac{OR\\left(p^0_{H_D|E},\\rho_\\text{D}(a_i)\\right)}{(1-p_{\\ICU | H}^i)p_{H | I}^iq_i},\n\\] where \\(p^0_{\\ICU | E}\\) is the baseline probability of requiring the ICU given infection, \\(p_{H_D|E}^0\\) is the probability of death on ward (without visiting ICU) given infection and \\(\\rho_\\text{D}(a_i)\\) is the protection against death given infection.\nIf individual \\(i\\) is in the ICU, then their probabilities of death in the ICU, \\(p_{\\ICU_D|\\ICU}^i\\), and death on the ward given they left ICU without dying, \\(p_{W_D|\\ICU_D^c}^i\\), are altered such that, \\[\n    p_{\\ICU_D|\\ICU}^i = \\frac{OR\\left(p^0_{\\ICU_D|E},\\rho_\\text{D}(a_i)\\right)}{p_{\\ICU | H}^ip_{H| I }^iq_i},\n\\] and, \\[\n    p_{W_D|\\ICU_D^c}^i = \\frac{OR\\left(p_{W_D|E}^0,\\rho_D(a_i)\\right)}{(1-p_{\\ICU_D|\\ICU}^i)p_{\\ICU | H}^ip_{H | I }^iq_i},\n\\] where \\(p^0_{\\ICU_D|E}\\) is the baseline probability of dying in the ICU and \\(p_{W_D|E}^0\\) is the baseline probability of dying in the ward after returning from the ICU. Note that we assume no difference between the protection from hospitalisation given infection and the protection from ICU given infection here.\nTo determine all parameters in Equation 2 and Equation 3, we use a re-implementation of Khoury et al. (2021) and Cromer et al. (2022) in a Bayesian framework (Golding 2022). This allows us to calibrate the level of protection, which is analogous to vaccine efficacy for individuals with no exposure to COVID-19, to observed clinical data. The model fit in Golding (2022) takes in a range of data relating neutralising antibody levels to efficacy, and estimates of vaccine efficacies from a range of studies to estimate efficacy over time against the Delta variant. To estimate the efficacies against the Omicron variant, Golding and colleagues estimate an ‘escape’ parameter for the Omicron variant relative to the Delta variant. This was done by using the relative rates of infection in Danish households between Omicron and Delta to estimate the the relative \\(R_0\\) between the variants, and early evidence of vaccine efficacies against Omicron from the UK to understand the level of vaccine escape. This was then combined with the information fit on the Delta variant to model waning over time for both the Delta and Omicron variants.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCromer, Deborah, Megan Steain, Arnold Reynaldi, Timothy E.

    "text": "To model the transmission of COVID-19 throughout the population of interest we have extended a previous individual-based model Conway et al. (2022) to account for loss of protection over time since vaccination. Waning of immunity is accounted for by explicitly modelling the boosting and decay of each individual’s neutralising antibody titre. This approach overcomes limitations of the typical SIRS model, where waning is modelled as an exponential distribution (or more generally as a phase type distribution), and enables us to investigate the possible impacts of variants of concern using the expected fold change in neutralising antibody titre.\nEach individual within the simulation is constructed using a known age, their corresponding age bracket within the contact matrix, a list of their vaccination history and the decay rate of their neutralising antibodies. Note that each individual’s entire vaccination history must be known a priori and is an input into the transmission model. This is in contrast to other IBMs that simulate the time of vaccination, however, this is a conscious design choice. By not directly simulating the vaccination roll-out within the transmission model, we have the increased benefit of being able to directly incorporate known vaccination information and can quickly and efficiently switch out different vaccination scenarios. This is an important feature of the IBM when working with policy makers, allowing for the quick adaptation of the model to help answer policy relevant questions. At the point of initialisation each individual is assumed to be susceptible and to have zero neutralising antibodies. Once an individual is constructed, they are dynamically stored within a vector.\nThe spread of infection is modelled by directly simulating contact between infectious and susceptible individuals. For an infectious individual \\(i\\) in age bracket \\(n\\), we sample the number of contacts that they make in age bracket \\(m\\) from a negative binomial (NB) distribution, such that, \\[\nC_m \\sim \\text{NB}\\left(r\\delta t, \\frac{\\Lambda_{n,m}}{r + \\Lambda_{n,m}}\\right),\n\\] where \\(C_m\\) (contacts/timestep) is the number of contacts made this timestep by the individual in age bracket \\(m\\), \\(r\\) (contacts/day) is the overdispersion parameter, \\(\\delta t\\) (day) is the size of the current time step and \\(\\Lambda_{n,m}\\) (contacts/day) is the mean number of daily contacts between age bracket \\(n\\) and \\(m\\). Note that we have used the definition of the negative binomial distribution where \\(\\text{NB}(r,p)\\) corresponds to probability density function \\(f(k)={k + r -1 \\choose r} p^k (1-p)^r\\). We then sample \\(C_m\\) contacts uniformly from individuals within the \\(m\\)th age bracket. If contact \\(j\\) is susceptible we determine if infection occurred using, \\[\n    I \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\tau_i\\xi_j),\n\\] where \\(I\\) is an indicator variable for successful infection, \\(\\tau_i\\) (dimensionless) is the infectiousness of the infectious individual \\(i\\) and \\(\\xi_j\\) (dimensionless) is the susceptibility of the contact \\(j\\). We note that \\(\\tau_i\\) depends upon the transmission potential of the population of interest (TPpaper?) and both \\(\\tau_i\\) and \\(\\xi_j\\) depend upon the underlying immunological model, and the heterogeneous characteristics of the individual of interest (for example, \\(\\tau_i\\) will be altered depending on the symptom status of the infectious individual and both \\(\\tau_i\\) and \\(\\xi_j\\) will depend upon age). This process of generating contacts and the resulting infections is repeated over all age brackets.\nAt the point of infection, whether an individual will be asymptomatic or symptomatic is sampled from \\[\n    Q \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(q_i),\n\\] where \\(Q\\) is an indicator variable for symptomatic infection and \\(q_i\\) is the probability that individual \\(i\\) will be symptomatic, which depends on the age and neutralising antibody titre of individual \\(i\\). We also sample the time that the newly exposed individual becomes infectious, the time for the onset of symptoms and the time that the individual will recover. Given mandated isolation requirements in Australia at the time of study, we further simulate the time of isolation in relation to symptom onset, which reduces the individual’s duration of infectiousness. Note that each of these times are sampled from known distributions based on local case data (TTIQpaper?). These data have also been used to estimate the likely constraining impact on transmission of active case and contact finding and management, collectively termed test, trace, isolate, quarantine (TTIQ) Conway et al. (2022). We include a factor to account for a ‘partial TTIQ’ effect under high case loads as in earlier work (Conway et al. 2022).\nWhen the infectious individual recovers, we store the individual’s age, time of symptom onset, neutralising antibody titre at exposure, symptom indicator (\\(Q\\)), the number of individuals they infected, their vaccine status (what was the latest vaccine they received) at exposure, the time they were isolated from the community and the number of times that they have been infected. This generates a line list of infections that is used to model Clinical Outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nConway, Eamon, Camelia Walker, Chris Baker, Michael Lydeamore, Gerard E Ryan, Trish Campbell, Joel C Miller, et al. 2022. “COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage Targets to Inform Reopening Plans in a Low Incidence Setting.” medRxiv, 2022–12."
