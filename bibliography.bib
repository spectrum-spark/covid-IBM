	abstract = {Predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19 are urgently needed to identify correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50\% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2\% of the mean convalescent level (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4–28.4\%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50\% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3\% of the mean convalescent level; 95\% CI = 0.7–13\%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.},

	doi = {10.1101/2022.03.16.22271361},

	abstract = {Aim To estimate the length of stay distributions of hospitalised COVID-19 cases during a mixed Omicron-Delta epidemic in New South Wales, Australia (16 Dec 2021 {\textendash} 7 Feb 2022), and compare these to estimates produced over a Delta-only epidemic in the same population (1 Jul 2021 {\textendash} 15 Dec 2022).Background The distribution of the duration that clinical cases of COVID-19 occupy hospital beds (the {\textquoteleft}length of stay{\textquoteright}) is a key factor in determining how incident caseloads translate into health system burden as measured through ward and ICU occupancy.Results Using data on the hospital stays of 19,574 individuals, we performed a competing-risk survival analysis of COVID-19 clinical progression. During the mixed Omicron-Delta epidemic, we found that the mean length of stay for individuals who were discharged directly from ward without an ICU stay was, for age groups 0-39, 40-69 and 70+ respectively, 2.16 (95\% CI: 2.12{\textendash}2.21), 3.93 (95\% CI: 3.78{\textendash}4.07) and 7.61 days (95\% CI: 7.31{\textendash}8.01), compared to 3.60 (95\% CI: 3.48{\textendash}3.81), 5.78 (95\% CI: 5.59{\textendash}5.99) and 12.31 days (95\% CI: 11.75{\textendash}12.95) across the preceding Delta epidemic (15 Jul 2021 {\textendash} 15 Dec 2021). We also considered data on the stays of individuals within the Hunter New England Local Health District, where it was reported that Omicron was the only circulating variant, and found mean ward-to-discharge length of stays of 2.05 (95\% CI: 1.80{\textendash}2.30), 2.92 (95\% CI: 2.50{\textendash}3.67) and 6.02 days (95\% CI: 4.91{\textendash}7.01) for the same age groups.Conclusions Hospital length of stay was substantially reduced across all clinical pathways during a mixed Omicron-Delta epidemic compared to a prior Delta epidemic. These changes in length of stay have contributed to lessened health system burden despite greatly increased infection burden and should be considered in future planning of response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and internationally.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was undertaken to inform the New South Wales COVID-19 pandemic response as part of a broader program of public health surveillance carried out under the NSW Public Health Act (2010). The study used routinely collected patient administration data from NSW public hospitals and the NSW Notifiable Conditions Information Management System (NCIMS). Data was supplied by the NSW Ministry of Health, with all records de-identified and securely managed to ensure patient privacy and to ensure the study{\textquoteright}s compliance with the National Health and Medical Research Council{\textquoteright}s Ethical Considerations in Quality Assurance and Evaluation Activities. The NSW Public Health Act (2010) allows for such release of data to identify and monitor risk factors for diseases and conditions that have a substantial adverse impact on the population and to improve service delivery. Following review, the NSW Ministry of Health determined that this study met that threshold and therefore provided approval for the study to proceed. The project oversight and approval for publication was provided by the NSW Ministry of Health.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).YesI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.YesThe analyses performed in the manuscript required access to patient administration data provided through the New South Wales Notifiable Conditions Information Management System (NCIMS), which is not able to be shared under the terms of our data access agreement.
