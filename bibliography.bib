	abstract = {Background In mid-2021, widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines with demonstrated impacts on transmission promised relief from the strict public health and social measures (PHSMs) imposed in many countries to limit spread and burden. We were asked to define vaccine coverage thresholds for transition through the stages of Australia{\textquoteright}s {\textquoteleft}National Plan{\textquoteright} to easing restrictions and reopening international borders.Methods Using available evidence of vaccine effectiveness against the then-circulating Delta variant, we used a mathematical model to determine vaccine coverage targets. The absence of any COVID-19 infections in many sub-national jurisdictions in Australia posed particular methodological challenges for modelling in this setting. We used a novel metric called Transmission Potential (TP) as a proxy measure of the population-level effective reproduction number. We estimated TP of the Delta variant under a range of PHSMs, test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) efficiencies, vaccination coverage thresholds, and age-based vaccine allocation strategies.Findings We found that high coverage of vaccination across all age groups (<= 70\%) combined with ongoing TTIQ and minimal PHSMs was sufficient to avoid strict lockdowns. At lesser coverage (>= 60\%) rapid case escalation risked overwhelming of the health sector and would prompt a need to reimpose strict restrictions, with substantive economic impacts in order to achieve the goals of the National Plan. Maintaining low case numbers was the most beneficial strategy for health and the economy, and at higher coverage levels (>= 80\%) further easing of restrictions was deemed possible.Interpretation These results reinforced recommendations from other modelling groups that some level of PHSMs should be continued to minimise the burden of the Delta variant following achievement of high population vaccine coverage. They directly informed easing of COVID-19 restrictions in Australia.Funding This study was supported by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, and the National Health and Medical Research Council{\textquoteright}s Centre of Research Excellence scheme (GNT1170960).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was directly funded by the Australian Government Department of Health Office of Health Protection.

	abstract = {Predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19 are urgently needed to identify correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50\% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2\% of the mean convalescent level (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4–28.4\%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50\% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3\% of the mean convalescent level; 95\% CI = 0.7–13\%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Aim To estimate the length of stay distributions of hospitalised COVID-19 cases during a mixed Omicron-Delta epidemic in New South Wales, Australia (16 Dec 2021 {\textendash} 7 Feb 2022), and compare these to estimates produced over a Delta-only epidemic in the same population (1 Jul 2021 {\textendash} 15 Dec 2022).Background The distribution of the duration that clinical cases of COVID-19 occupy hospital beds (the {\textquoteleft}length of stay{\textquoteright}) is a key factor in determining how incident caseloads translate into health system burden as measured through ward and ICU occupancy.Results Using data on the hospital stays of 19,574 individuals, we performed a competing-risk survival analysis of COVID-19 clinical progression. During the mixed Omicron-Delta epidemic, we found that the mean length of stay for individuals who were discharged directly from ward without an ICU stay was, for age groups 0-39, 40-69 and 70+ respectively, 2.16 (95\% CI: 2.12{\textendash}2.21), 3.93 (95\% CI: 3.78{\textendash}4.07) and 7.61 days (95\% CI: 7.31{\textendash}8.01), compared to 3.60 (95\% CI: 3.48{\textendash}3.81), 5.78 (95\% CI: 5.59{\textendash}5.99) and 12.31 days (95\% CI: 11.75{\textendash}12.95) across the preceding Delta epidemic (15 Jul 2021 {\textendash} 15 Dec 2021). We also considered data on the stays of individuals within the Hunter New England Local Health District, where it was reported that Omicron was the only circulating variant, and found mean ward-to-discharge length of stays of 2.05 (95\% CI: 1.80{\textendash}2.30), 2.92 (95\% CI: 2.50{\textendash}3.67) and 6.02 days (95\% CI: 4.91{\textendash}7.01) for the same age groups.Conclusions Hospital length of stay was substantially reduced across all clinical pathways during a mixed Omicron-Delta epidemic compared to a prior Delta epidemic. These changes in length of stay have contributed to lessened health system burden despite greatly increased infection burden and should be considered in future planning of response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and internationally.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was undertaken to inform the New South Wales COVID-19 pandemic response as part of a broader program of public health surveillance carried out under the NSW Public Health Act (2010).
